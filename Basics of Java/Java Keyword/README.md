# Java Keywords.
In JAva, keywords or Reserved words are the words in a language that are used for some internal process or represent some predefined actions. These words are therefore not allowed to use as variable names or objects.

If we do, we will get a compile-time error as shown below:

### Example of Java Programming Keywords

```java
public class JavaKeywords {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        // Note 'this' is a reserved word in Java
        String this = "Hello Java Keywords!";
        System.out.println(this);
    }
}
```

### Output

```java
error: not a statement
        String this = "Hello Java Keywords!";
               ^
error: ';' expected
        String this = "Hello Java Keywords!";
                    ^
2 errors
```

## Java Keywords List Accordingly Chapter Wise
Java contains a list of keywords or reserved words which are also highlighted with different colors in IDEs or Code Editiors. They are listed below with their primary actions:

### Data Types & Variables

| **Keyword** | **Usage** |
|-------------|-----------|
| boolean | A data type that can hold `true` and `false` values only. |
| byte | A data type that holds 8-bit data values. |
| char | A data type that holds unsigned 16-bit Unicode characeters. |
| double | A data type that holds 64-bit floating-point numbers. |
| float | A data type that holds 32-bit floating-point numbers. |
| int | A data type that holds a 32-bit signed integer. |
| long | A data type that holds a 64-bit integer. |
| short | A data type that holds a 16-bit integer. |

### Class & Object Handling 

|**Keyword** | **Usage** |
|------------|-----------|
| class | Declares a new class. |
| interface | Declares an interface. |
| extends | Indicates inheriteance between classes and interfaces. |
| implements | Specifies that a class implements an interface. |
| new | Create new objects. |
| super | Refers to superclass. |
| this | Refers to the current instance of a class. |

### Control Statements 

| **Keyword** | **Usage** |
|-------------|-----------|
| switch | A control statement for multi-way branching. |
| case | Used in switch statements to mark blocks of text. |
| break | A control statement for breaking out of loops. |
| continue | Sends control back outside a loop. |
| default | Specfies the default block of code in a switch statement. |
| for | Used to start a `for` loop. |
| do | Starts a do-whhile loop. |
| while | Starts a `while` loop. |
| if | Tests a true/false expression and branches accordingly. |
| else | Indicates alternative branches in an `if` statement. |

### Exception Handling 

| **Keyword** | **Usage** |
|-------------|-----------|
| assert | Describes a predicate to indicate it's always true at that place. |
| catch | Catches exceptions generated by try statements. |
| finally | Ensures execution of code in a try-catch structure. |
| throw | Creates an exception. | 
| throws | Indicates the exceptions a method can throw. |
| try | Starts a block of code that can handle exceptions. |

### Access Modifiers & Packages

| **Keyword** | **Usage** |
|-------------|-----------|
| import | References other classes. |
| package | Declares a Java package. |
| public | Declares members accessible everywhere. |
| private | Declares members accessible within the class only. |
| protected | Declares members accessible within the package or subclass. |

### Modifiers & Non-Access Modifiers

| **Keyword** | **Usage** |
|-------------|-----------|
| abstract | Specifies that a class or method will be implemented later, in a subclass. |
| final | Declares constants or prevents method overriding. |
| native | Indicates platform-dependent code. |
|static | Declares class-level fields or method. |
| strictfp | Ensure consistent floating-point calculations. |
| synchronized | Ensures thread-safe operatons. |
| transient | Excludes a field from serialization. |
| volatile | Marks a variable as modified asynchronously. |

### Special Keywords

| **Keyword** | **Usage** |
|-------------|-----------|
| instanceof | Tests whether an object is an instance of a class. |
| null | Indicates a reference that does not point to anything. |
| return | Sends control and potentially a value back from a method. |
| void | Indicates a method does not return a value. |
| sealed | Declares a class that restricts which classes can extend it. |
| permits | Specifieis the permitted subclasses of a sealed class. |

### Reserved Keywords (Unused)

| **Keyword** | **Usage** |
|-------------|-----------|
| const | Reserved for future use. |
| goto | Reserved for future use. |

### Literals (Not Keywords)

- **true, false, null**
These are literals, not actually keywords, but they still can not be used as identifiers in a program.

### Important Points
- Keywords are case-sensitive.
- They're highlighted with different colours in IDEs and Code Editors.
- Can't be used as identifiers (variables, classes, methods,...etc.)


| **Keyword** | **Usage** |

| catch | Catches exceptions generated by try statement. |
